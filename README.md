# Eleanor

Elegant and nearly zero-config routing, for React/Redux apps

# About

react-router is a perfectly fine piece of software but I don't like the idea of having to render my route tree, or even of assuming that there's a (non-shallow) tree of routes at all.  I wanted something tiny which worked like page.js but which used Redux to notify my app of route changes, and which isn't coupled with React, so here we are: a ~6KB (prod-minified) routing library named after my cat.

# Getting Started

    $ npm install --save eleanor

# Usage

Briefly: import/require the module in your usual way, create a new Router object, and pass it a list of objects each containing an Express-compatible route string and a React component (or, I suppose, any other thing you want associated with that route string).

Here's a simple example in ES6:

    /******** appReducer.js ********/
    
    
    import {
      actionType as CHANGE_ROUTE
    } from 'eleanor';
    
    const INITIAL_STATE = {
      routeInfo: {
        route: null,
        component: null
      }
    };
    
    const appReducer = (currentState = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case CHANGE_ROUTE:
          return {
            ...currentState,
            routeInfo: action.payload
          };
      }
    };
    
    
    /******** index.js ********/
    
    
    import Router from 'eleanor';

    import App from 'components/App';
    import MyChildComponent from 'components/MyChildComponent';
    import SomeOtherChildComponent from 'components/SomeOtherChildComponent';
    import YetAnotherChildComponent from 'components/YetAnotherChildComponent';
    
    import appReducer from 'reducers/appReducer';
    
    let appStore = createStore(appReducer);
    
    const router = new Router({
      store: appStore,
      routes: [{
        route: '/page1',
        component: MyChildComponent
      }, {
        route: '/page2/:param',
        component: SomeOtherChildComponent
      }, {
        route: '/page3/:param/:optionalParam?',
        component: YetAnotherChildComponent
      }]
    });
    
    router.startRouting({
      initialRoute: '/page1'
    });
    
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('wherever'));
    
    
    /******** App.js ********/
    
    
    import React from 'react';
    import {
      connect
    } from 'react-redux';
    
    const mapStateToProps = (appState) => {
      return appState.routeInfo;
    };

    const App = (props) => {
      const {
        component: ChildComponent
      } = props;
      
      return (
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="#/page1">Page 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#/page2/foo">Page 2</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#/page3/foo/bar">Page 3</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          {ChildComponent && (
            <ChildComponent />
          )}
        </div>
      );
    };
    
    export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);

# API

## Router({opts})

    const router = new Router({
      store: Object // a Redux store.  required
      routes: Array<Object>  // a list of route definitions
    });

creates a new Eleanor router and, optionally, provide some routes.  `store` is the Redux store upon which the router will dispatch actions, and is a required field.  `routes` is a list of route-definition objects; each route-definition object must have, at minimum, a field named `route`:

    {
      route: String
    }
    
This route-definition object will be the payload of the action dispatched to your Redux store.  Put anything else in there you want:
    {
      route: '/page1',
      foo: 'bar'
    }
    
## Router.registerRoutes(routes)

    router.registerRoutes(
      Array<Object> // a list of route definitions
    );

tells your router to use a new set of routes.  `routes` is a list of route-definition objects; each route-definition object must have, at minimum, a field named `route`:

    {
      route: String
    }
    
This route-definition object will be the payload of the action dispatched to your Redux store.  Put anything else in there you want:
    {
      route: '/page1',
      foo: 'bar'
    }
    
### Router.startRouting({opts})

    router.startRouting({
      initialRoute: '/page1', // a route registered with this router
      useLocationHash: false // set to true if you want to route to the current location hash (falling back to `initialRoute` if no hash is present)
    });

tells your router to start listening for route changes.  Specify `initialRoute` if you want to set a specific route initially; specify `useLocationHash` if you want to set the initial route to whatever's specified by the current page location hash (falling back to `initialRoute` if no location hash is present, then `/` if `initialRoute` is not specified).

### Router.stopRouting()

    router.stopRouting();

tells your router to stop listening for route changes.

### Router.setLocation(route)

    router.setLocation('/some/app/path');

tells your router to go to the path provided and dispatch an action to your app state.

# Redux Actions

A Redux action is created and dispatched upon each route change:

    import {
      actionType
    } from 'eleanor';
    
    const reducer = (state = {}, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case actionType:
          // route-change action was dispatched!
      }
    };

The dispatched action is a [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action):

    type: String // action type
    payload: Object // the matched route-definition object
    meta: Object // additional information such as route params

`payload` is the matched route-definition objects passed to the router by the user.  `meta` is an object containing some information about the matched route:
    {
      routeParams: Object, // route param -> value map
      path: String // the actual current path (as opposed to the matched string)
    }

# Testing

I've tested this with exactly one app in one browser on one platform.  I don't think I'm doing anything too crazy or stupid in the code, but caveat emptor.
